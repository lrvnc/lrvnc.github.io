        "Hi, and welcome to my personal page! I'm Leandro, originally from Limeira — a not-so-small city in the countryside of São Paulo, Brazil. I'm currently a PhD student in the QUEX joint program, working at the intersection of Physics and Computer Science. My research lies in the multidisciplinary field of Optical Computing, where I explore how light can be harnessed to perform machine learning tasks, accelerate processing, reduce energy consumption during training and inference, and more.",
        "I love traveling and discovering new places. But more than that, I value the connections made along the way — it's the people who make the journey meaningful. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or just have a good chat!"
